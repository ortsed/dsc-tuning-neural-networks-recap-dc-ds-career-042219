    "In this section, you built upon your previous understanding of Keras and neural networks in order to further tune these models to optimize performance. You saw how optimization can go wrong with exploding gradients if normalization is not properly applied and how to prune overfit models using regularization."

    "\n",
    "* In deep learning a training, validation and test set are used when iteratively building the right deep networks\n",
    "* Like traditional machine learning models, we need to watch out for the bias variance trade-off when building deep learning models\n",
    "* Several regularization techniques can help us limit overfitting: L1 Regularization, L2 Regularization, Dropout Regularization,...\n",
    "* Deep network training can be sped up by using normalized inputs\n",
    "* Normalized inputs can also help mitigate a common issue of vanishing or exploding gradients\n",
    "* You learned about gradient descent, but in deep learning some other optimization algorithms are introduced that work faster than gradient descent\n",
    "* Examples of alternatives for gradient descent are: RMSprop, Adam, Gradient Descent with Momentum\n",
    "* Hyperparameter tuning is of crucial important when working with deep learning models, as setting the parameters right can lead to great model improvements"
